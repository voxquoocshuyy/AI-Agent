# Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the AI Agent project, including authentication, authorization, and various security middleware components.

## Authentication
The application uses JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication with the following features:
- Token-based authentication using JWT
- Configurable token expiration and refresh
- Secure token storage and validation
- Support for multiple authentication schemes

### JWT Configuration
```json
{
  "JwtSettings": {
    "SecretKey": "your-secret-key",
    "Issuer": "ai-agent",
    "Audience": "ai-agent-api",
    "ExpirationInMinutes": 60,
    "RefreshTokenExpirationInDays": 7
  }
}
```

## Authorization
Role-based authorization is implemented with the following features:
- Custom authorization policy provider
- Role-based access control
- Policy-based authorization
- Support for multiple roles and permissions

### Available Policies
- `RequireAdminRole`: Requires the user to have the Admin role
- `RequireUserRole`: Requires the user to have the User role
- `RequireApiKey`: Requires a valid API key

## Security Middleware

### Security Headers
The application implements various security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection`: Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Restricts resource loading
- `Permissions-Policy`: Controls browser features

### Rate Limiting
The application implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- Token bucket algorithm
- Configurable request limits
- Per-client rate limiting
- Customizable time windows

## CORS Configuration
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured with the following settings:
- Configurable allowed origins
- Support for credentials
- Specific HTTP methods and headers
- Secure by default

### CORS Policy
```json
{
  "AllowedOrigins": [
    "https://your-frontend-domain.com"
  ]
}
```

## Input Validation
The application implements input validation to prevent injection attacks:
- Model validation using Data Annotations
- Custom validation attributes
- Request size limits
- Content type validation

## Security Best Practices
1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Keep dependencies updated
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use secure configuration management
5. Regular security audits
6. Monitor for suspicious activities

## Usage Examples

### Protected Endpoint
```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireUserRole")]
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult GetProtectedData()
{
    // Your protected endpoint logic
}
```

### Admin Only Endpoint
```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdminRole")]
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult AdminOnlyAction()
{
    // Your admin-only endpoint logic
}
```

## Future Improvements
1. Implement two-factor authentication
2. Add support for OAuth2 providers
3. Implement API key rotation
4. Add support for IP-based rate limiting
5. Implement request signing
6. Add support for API versioning
7. Implement audit logging
8. Add support for security headers customization

## Security Considerations
1. Store sensitive configuration in secure vaults
2. Implement proper logging for security events
3. Regular security testing
4. Monitor for security vulnerabilities
5. Implement proper backup strategies
6. Regular security training for developers
